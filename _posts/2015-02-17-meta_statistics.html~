--><div class="content"><!--introduction--><p>Some times the user may be in need of not only evaluating nestedness and/or modularity in a single bipartite network, but in a set of related networks. There exists many examples in the literature of how these kinds of analysis are performed (i.e. see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/28/E288.abstract">Flores et al 2011</a> for Phage-bacteria and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/100/16/9383.full">Bascompte et al 2003</a> for plant-pollinator networks). <tt>BiMat</tt> comes with a couple of classes that the user can use in order to perform this kind of analysis. The name of these classes are <tt>MetaStatistics</tt> and <tt>MetaStatisticsPlotter</tt>. The main functionality of the first one is to take as input an entire set of bipartite networks and perform modularity and nested analysis among them. Finally, the second class is used in order to have a better visual understanding of the results.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Example: Seed dispersal networks</a></li></ul></div><h2>Example: Seed dispersal networks<a name="1"></a></h2><p>This example will show how to perform this kind of analysis. In order to do that, we will use seed-dispersal bipartite networks. These networks were collected for Bascompte's lab website <a href="http://www.web-of-life.es/">The Web of Life</a>. We will explain the process of this kind of analysis from the point in which the user have already a set of data sets, which in these case correspond to bipartite matrices encoded in text files. The data used in this example can be located inside the <tt>examples/data/</tt> directory.</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">%We will need first to read the data and create all the required matrices.</span>

Equally possible is to chose the number of replicates by matrix, the null model, and the nested and modularity algorithms. If the properties are not updated, the <tt>BiMat</tt> will as usual use the default values specified on the file <tt>base/Options.m</tt>. Continuing with the experiment, we will just focus on evaluating Nestedness using NODF algorithm, with 100 replicates and the most simple null model:</p><pre class="codeinput"><span class="comment">%Configure the meta-analysis experiment</span>
meta_stat.do_community = false;
meta_stat.do_nestedness = true; <span class="comment">%default value</span>
meta_stat.nestedness_algorithm = @NestednessNODF;
meta_stat.replicates = 100;

meta_stat = MetaStatistics(bip_networks);

%The next value will be used for the error bars of the plot
meta_stat.plotter.p_value = 0.05; %Default value
%plot the results
