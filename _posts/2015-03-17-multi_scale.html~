%% Multi-Scale Statistics
% An ecological network may look modular or nested depending on the scale
% at which it is observed 
% (see <http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v7/n3/abs/ismej2012135a.html Flores et al
% 2013> for an example). For example, if we focus at the global scale
% of the network we may infer that the network is modular and not nested.
% However, if we go to the inner community modules (after performing one of the
% modularity algorithms) we may discover that they are actually nested.
% Performing this kind of analysis may be exhausting, specially if nothing
% is to be found. However, |BiMat| provides the tools for performing a
% first exploratory analysis that we call Multi-scale Statistics.
%
% Under this kind of analysis, |BiMat| first find what are the modular
% structure of the network. Once we found what are the modules, |BiMat|
% treat them as independent networks by performing a meta-statistics
% analsyis on them. Finally, if the user have available data about node
% classification, this data can be used by |BiMat| to analyze if the
% modular structure may be explained by node classification (i.e. nodes from
% the same class may be clustered inside the same module). In order to do
% that |BiMat| can make use of two kind of diversity indexes that can be applied to
% row and/or column modules:
%
% * *Simpson's Index of Diversity* : $1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^c n_i (n_i -1)}{N (N-1)}$ 
% * *Shannon's Index of Diversity*: $-\sum_{i=1}^c \frac{n_i}{N} \log \frac{n_i}{N}$
%
% where (assuming it will be used on the row species) $c$ is the number of modules,
% $n_i$ the number of row species
% belonging to module $i$, and $N$ the number of row species.
%% Example: Moebus Meta-scale analysis
% In this example we will describe how to perform this kind of statistical
% analysis in a network that is large enough. This network is composed
% of 286 bacteria vs 215 phages that represents the largest cross-infection
% study to date. The phages and bacteria
% strains were collected across multiple geographical locations across the
% Atlantic ocean (and we will use this locations as node classes).
% We will see that this network is modular at the global scale (entire
