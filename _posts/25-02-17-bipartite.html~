%% Bipartite class
% The |Bipartite| is the fundamental class of the |BiMat| software. This
% class works as an encapsulator of most of the available classes.
% Altough it is possible to work with |BiMat| wihout using the |Bipartite|
% class, its use facilitates the access to most of the |BiMat| features.
%
% The main input of the Bipartite class is a matlab matrix, where the rows
% will represent the node set $R$ and the columns the node
% set $C$, such that if the element |matrix(i,j)>0| a link between node
% $R_i$ and $C_j$ exist. This matrix input can contain only non-negative 
% integers $\{0,1,2,3...\}$. However, the user need to know that values bigger 
% than 1 are only used during plotting (i.e. color interactions according
% to weight) and not in the existing algorithms (which only work in the 
% boolean version of the matrix).
%
%% Optional input
% |Bipartite| class has two different types of optional input. The first type is for
% node labeling and the main use of it will be for labeling row and column
% nodes during plotting. The input must be encoded in a cell of strings for
% each set $R$ and $C$ of nodes, such that each string in a cell corresponds
% to the label of a node. The size of such cells must correspond to the
% number of nodes.
%
% The second type of output consist of the type of node for either row and
% column nodes. For an example of type of nodes consider a bipartite
% network where $R$ and $C$ represent pollinators and plants respectivally.
% In turn pollinators can be classified in birds and insects, which will be
% the classification for set $R$. The information of this classification
% is useful to explain modularity in terms of node classification. You can
% consult the Multi-scale statistics for extended description. The classification input
% must be vectors of the same size than the number of nodes in rows and
% columns. The values must be positive integers $\{1,2,3,...\}$.
% 
%% |Bipartite| object creation
% There exist many ways of creating a |Bipartite| object. Either the user
% can create it from scratch using |Matlab| commands matrices and cells, or it can be created from
% text files.
%
% <html><h3>Creating it from scratch</h3></html>
%
% Here, we will show an example of the simplest way of creating a Bipartite
% object:
%Creating the adjacency matrix
matrix = [2 0 2 2;...
          1 2 2 1;...
          2 0 0 2;...
          0 1 2 2;...
          0 0 1 0];
% For the next variables observe that the size of matrix 5x4 correlates with
% them
%creating row and column labels
row_labels = {'insect 1', 'insect 2', 'insect 3', 'bird 1', 'bird 2'};
col_labels = {'flower 1', 'flower 2', 'grass 1', 'gras 2'};
%class row ids (1 correspond to insect, 3 to bird specie).
row_ids = [1 1 1 3 3];
%class column ids (1 to flower, 5 to grass specie)
col_ids = [1 1 5 5];
%%
% Using the data we just created we can now create our Bipartite object:
bp = Bipartite(matrix);
bp.row_labels = row_labels;
bp.col_labels = col_labels;
bp.row_class = row_ids;
bp.col_class = col_ids;
%Peform a simple plot of the network
figure(1);
set(gcf,'position',[360   138   929   592]);
bp.plotter.use_labels = true; %default is to plot labels
bp.plotter.font_size = 16;
subplot(1,2,1);
bp.plotter.PlotMatrix;
subplot(1,2,2);
bp.plotter.link_width = 2.0;
bp.plotter.PlotGraph;
%%
% The colors in the matrix cells and graph links correspond to the
% different values in the adjacency matrix input. As already mentioned,
% these values are only used for plotting, not for calculating modularity
% or nestedness (in which the boolean version of the matrix is used).
%
% <html><h3>Creating Bipartite objects from text files</h3></html>
%
% An additional way of creating a |Bipartite| object is by using the static functions from
% the |Reader.m| class. Currently two different formats are available.
% The first input format will contain only the information of the adjacency
% matrix (you will need to add row/column labels and ids if you need it). A
% file example for creating the last data will be:
%
%  2 0 2 2
%  1 2 2 1
%  2 0 0 2
%  0 1 2 2
%  0 0 1 0
%
% The last format input can be called using:
bp = Reader.READ_BIPARTITE_MATRIX('data/input_matrix.txt');
% We need to add labels and classification ids by ourselves
bp.row_labels = row_labels;
bp.col_labels = col_labels;
bp.row_class = row_ids;
bp.col_class = col_ids;
%%
% The second input format consists on writing the adjacency list. This input
% format will read also the row and column node labels. The user still need to add
% the classification ids if he needs it. An example of this kind of input
% text fill will look like:
%
%  insect_1 2 flower_1
%  insect_1 2 grass_1
%  insect_1 2 grass_2
%  insect_2 1 flower_1
%  insect_2 2 flower_2
%  insect_2 2 grass_1
%  insect_2 1 grass_2
%  insect_3 2 flower_1
%  insect_3 2 grass_2
%  bird_1 1 flower_2
%  bird_1 2 grass_1
%  bird_1 2 grass_2
%  bird_2 1 grass_1
%
% The middle columns is optional. If it is not used, the reading function
% will assume that it is composed of ones only. We can now just call:
bp = Reader.READ_ADJACENCY_LIST('input_adja.txt.');
% Wee need to add classification ids by ourselves
bp.row_class = row_ids;
bp.col_class = col_ids;
